/*

Dagger is a compile-time dependency injection which is used for creating the classes object's
 when you don't use dagger and do the hardcoded implementation in class: it Prevents the four issue :


Tight Coupling: Hardcoded dependencies make classes like UserRegistration difficult to change without modifying the class itself. Dagger 2 allows for loose coupling, making the class more flexible.

Poor Testability: Hardcoding makes it difficult to inject mocks for testing. Dagger 2 allows you to inject mock dependencies, making testing easier.

Code Reusability: Hardcoded dependencies reduce reusability because the class is tied to specific implementations. Dagger 2 allows you to reuse classes with different implementations of their dependencies.

Scalability Issues: Hardcoding increases the complexity and maintenance burden as the application grows. Dagger 2 keeps classes clean and manageable by handling dependency creation and injection separately.

By using Dagger 2, you keep your code clean, maintainable, and scalable, avoiding the pitfalls of hardcoding dependencies.
